"""
Actions are pieces of workflow. Actions have a name and start/end time, and actions can be traced.

This module provides simple instrumentation to enable logging of actions, and - when client
libraries are installed - submission of actions to storages compatible with
<https://opentracing.io/docs/overview/>`_.

Actions - which are wrapping Open Tracing's _span_ objects - can form an acyclic graph - actions
can have a single parent, it is then possible to start with a "root" action (e.g. "running the pipeline")
from which are children actions spawned (e.g. "executing module") and these actions can become parents
to actions spawned deeper in modules, end so on and on, forming a nice overview of what the code did, how
long did it took, and what are the dependencies between actions, i.e. what subactions were necessary to
perform a particular action.

Each execution of Gluetool pipeline forms a _trace_, which consists of multiple _spans_. Each action
represents a single span, wrapping its properties and dependencies.

.. code-block:: python

   with Action('some label', parent=parent_action, tags={'foo': 'bar'}) as action:
      # do some work

      with Action('some subtask', parent=action):
          # e.g. fetching a webpage

      with Action('another subtask', parent=action):
          # e.g. validating page's source code

For the example above, you get a trace capturing dependencies between a prent task and its two children, how
long they spent doing their job, how it affected the parent. Instrument interesting pieces of your code,
e.g. interaction with remote services, and get an overview of your workflow on a level of "symbolical" actions.

When a supported tracing client is installed, spans created by actions actions are reported to the remote storage.

Supported clients:

    * https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python

To control behavior of tracing subsystem, you can use following environment variables:

    * ``GLUETOOL_TRACING_DISABLE`` - when set to anything, tracing won't be enabled even when a client
      is available.
    * ``GLUETOOL_TRACING_SERVICE_NAME`` - given string is used to name the trace produced by ``gluetool`` execution.
    * ``GLUETOOL_TRACING_REPORTING_HOST`` - given string represents a hostname where service, capturing
        traces, listens.
    * ``GLUETOOL_TRACING_REPORTING_PORT`` - given integer represents a port number where service, capturing
        traces, listens.
