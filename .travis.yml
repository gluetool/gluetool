# Paralellize by telling Travis what our matrix looks like - we reduce the actual command
# to just calling `tox` with a single environment, specified by `TOX_ENV`, which is set
# multiple times. Travis will take care of creating necessary threads.

    include:
      - python: 2.7

      # For type-check, we need Python 3 to power `mypy`. It's going to check types for both
      # Python 3 *and* 2, therefore it's perfectly fine to run it just once.
